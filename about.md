I am a software and security engineer based in
[Recife](https://goo.gl/maps/zydFuxsk54fsfzDk7) with 6+ years of experience.
Since 2020, I'm also building [Unxpose](https://www.unxpose.com/) a solution
that simplifies cybersecurity for busy companies.

This is a place where I publish personal thoughts, research and things I learnt
while working with computers. I hope you can find something useful here. I
haven't been doing much research lately, but you can find some old references
below.
